# SpdxLicenseCompatibility

A simple meteor application compare spdx licenses

this application is still very much work in progress. The idea is to
create a simple interface to compare two licenses and add all relevant
compatibility information in a structured way.

We use spdx licenses ID and we restrict ourselves only to those licenses.

To test : Install meteor and run the application

admin : admin@example.com / apple1
user : normal@example.com / apple1
editor : editor@example.com / apple1
